This report examines A-optimal weighing designs using a spring balance for n =4,5,6,7,8, and 11 objects. By minimizing the trace of the inverse information matrix (X′X)−1, we identify optimal experimental designs that minimize the av
erage variance of parameter estimates. Our computational results reveal multiple A-optimal designs for each problem size, with interesting connections to balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs) and D-optimal designs. A key finding is that for
 n =4, certain designs achieve both A-optimality and D-optimality simultaneously. This work contributes to the theory of experimental design by providing a comprehensive characterization of A-optimal weighing designs across multiple problem
 sizes.
